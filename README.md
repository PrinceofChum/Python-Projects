## What I did.

### Bank Account Manager

[Annamalai Palani](https://github.com/annshiv/) guided me to make this.

    -- The goal is to create a class called Account which will be an abstract
     class for three other classes called Checking Account, Savings Account
     and Business Account. Then we should manage credits and debits from these
     accounts through an ATM style program
