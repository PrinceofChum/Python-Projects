## What here is

### Bank Account Manager

[Annamalai Palani](https://github.com/annshiv/) guided me to make this.

    -- The goal is to create a class called Account which will be an abstract
     class for three other classes called Checking Account, Savings Account 
     and Business Account. Then we should manage credits and debits from these 
     accounts through an ATM style program
     
### Feet To Meter Converter

    -This app will covert feet into meter.
